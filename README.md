## Data Information
The data used in this project is sourced from Our World in Data.  The datasets necessary for project completion are given here [Data](./Data).  These datasets represent Life Expectancies, GDP's per Capita, Total Healthcare Expenditures, and Daily per Capita Caloric Supplies from countries around the world.
